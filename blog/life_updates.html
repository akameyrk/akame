                    <p>life’s been pretty chill - just wanted to get the first update on here. starting with youtube, it’s been going surprisingly better than i thought. these last few months have been my greatest, ever. not in terms of performance but also just.. good content. a big part of that is the videos being longer. i have more time to just have fun, relax on the editing, and try building a story and characters. only worry right now is maintaining this momentum. either way, i’ve learned, and my goal is to never stop learning and to continuously apply my learnings. if you’ve ever seen one of my videos (or even not), thank you! i appreciate it so much. i hope i can create something special for both of us one day.</p>

                    <p>i’ve been reading two books and one manga these last few weeks- meditations by marcus aurelius, before the coffee gets cold by ., and golden kamuy by ..</p>

                    <p>meditations is an outstanding book. only on book 3 of his writings, but it feels as if i’m getting this wisdom that only comes from deep inspection of yourself and the world around you as well as time. as much as i may dislike it, the longer you’ve lived the more time you’ve had to reflect and embody your morals. i have this mini notebook where i write my thoughts on each section of each book in meditations - my understanding of what he wrote, my interpretation, my learning. i hope to reread this book in the future many times and keep many journals of my understanding, so that one day i can reflect on each interpretation and the differences.</p>

                    <p>i’m only halfway through this book and i really like it. it seems to be short stories in this particular cafe that can travel you into the past, but with many, many rules. the second story about alzheimer’s did get me a bit, may have shed a tear for her.</p>

                    <p>this manga is really interesting, i’m into the main character as well as aspira and their adventures. i’m not super sold on the main antagonist (only on ch37?) but i won’t judge too soon.</p>
